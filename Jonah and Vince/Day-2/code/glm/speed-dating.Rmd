```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.align="center")
```

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rstan)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
```

## Load and look at the data

```{r load-data}
speed_dating <- read.csv("speed_dating.csv.gz")
round(speed_dating[1:3,], 2)
```

## Setup

* Thousands of undergrad interactions
* Spend a few minutes, rate other on axes
* Decide if "would date"

Structure of data:

 * studentId
 * isMale - person rating
 * match - person rating and rated both agree
 * wouldDate - person rating would date
 * attractiveness - of person _rated_
 * sincerity
 * item ...

## Fit simple model

```{r engine='cat', engine.opts=list(file = "mod0.stan", lang = "stan")}
data {
  int <lower = 0> N;
  int <lower = 0, upper = 1> wouldDate[N];
  
  vector[N] x_attractiveness;
  vector[N] x_sincerity;
  vector[N] x_intelligence;
  vector[N] x_ambition;
}
parameters {
  real intercept;
  real attractiveness;
  real sincerity;
  real intelligence;
  real ambition;
}
model {
  wouldDate ~ bernoulli_logit(intercept +
                              x_attractiveness * attractiveness +
                              x_sincerity * sincerity +
                              x_intelligence * intelligence +
                              x_ambition * ambition);
  intercept      ~ cauchy(0, 10);
  attractiveness ~ cauchy(0, 2.5);
  sincerity      ~ cauchy(0, 2.5);
  intelligence   ~ cauchy(0, 2.5);
  ambition       ~ cauchy(0, 2.5);
}
```

```{r fit-simple-logit, results="hide"}
## pull out and rename covariates
data <- as.list(speed_dating[c(
  "attractiveness", "sincerity",
  "intelligence",   "ambition")])

## rename to match model
names(data) <- paste0("x_", names(data))
data$wouldDate <- speed_dating$wouldDate
data$N <- nrow(speed_dating)


fit1 <- stan("mod0.stan", data = data)
```
```{r print-simple-logit-fit}
fit1
```

## Exercise: Posterior Probabilities

Compute the posterior probability that attractiveness is unimportant (has a slope less than or equal to 0)

```{r post-prob}
samples <- as.matrix(fit1)[,1:5] ## throw out __lp

## ...
```

Plot a histogram of the posterior of attractiveness

```{r post-hist}
## ...
```

## Making Predictions

Predictions from a fitted logistic regression require holding most predictors at particular values while varying the others.

```{r post-pred}
testVal <- with(speed_dating,
   mean(attractiveness) + sd(attractiveness))

pred <- c(1,       # intercept
          testVal, # attractiveness
          mean(speed_dating$sincerity),
          mean(speed_dating$intelligence),
          mean(speed_dating$ambition))
## x_i' * beta
## samples[1,] gets converted into a column
crossprod(pred, samples[1,])
```

This quantity is on a linear scale, apply `plogis` to get on probability scale.

## Exercise: Making Predictions

What is the difference in probability of being dateable between two otherwise average individuals who differ in attractiveness by being one half standard deviation above and one half standard deviation below the mean?

Calculate first a single value, then plot the posterior distribution of estimated differences.

```{r high-low-pred}
pred.low  <- pred
pred.high <- pred

## ...
```

```{r high-low-hist}

## ...
```

## Graphing Fitted Lines

Move our "test value" sequentially through range and collect predictions. We can do so for a single draw from the posterior as follows:

```{r graphing}
xRange <- range(speed_dating$attractiveness)

n.vals <- 101
xVals <- seq(xRange[1], xRange[2], length.out = 101)

## march through values, get prediction
yVals <- rep(NA, n.vals)
for (i in seq_len(n.vals)) {
  pred[2] <- xVals[i]
  yVals[i] <- plogis(crossprod(pred, samples[1,]))
}

## draw observed points
with(speed_dating,
  plot(attractiveness, wouldDate, pch = 20))
## connect predictions with lines
lines(xVals, yVals)
```

## Posterior Uncertainty in Fitted Lines

Because Stan gives us a whole collection of samples from the posterior, we can show both our posterior mean and the uncertainty in the fit by drawing multiple lines.

```{r graphing-uncertainty}
n.fits <- 20

with(speed_dating,
  plot(attractiveness, wouldDate, pch = 20))

## repeat the above 20 times
for (j in seq_len(n.fits)) {
  yVals <- rep(NA, n.vals)
   for (i in seq_len(n.vals)) {
    pred[2] <- xVals[i]
    yVals[i] <- plogis(crossprod(pred, samples[j,]))
  }
  lines(xVals, yVals, col = "gray")
}
for (i in seq_len(n.vals)) {
  pred[2] <- xVals[i]
  yVals[i] <- plogis(crossprod(pred, apply(samples, 2, mean)))
}
lines(xVals, yVals)
```

## Exercise: Posterior Uncertainty in Fitted Lines

Produce a similar plot for another coefficient

```{r graphing-uncertainty-exercise}
pred[2] <- mean(speed_dating$attractiveness)
## e.g.: xRange <- range(speed_dating$sincerity)
## ...
```

## Concluding Thoughts

Prediction code can be cleaned up significantly by turning into functions. Predictions themselves gets significantly harder if the model include interactions. E.g. suppose we have the model

    wouldDate ~ bernoulli_logit(intercept + attractiveness + isMale + attractiveness * isMale)

To obtain predictions for when the rater is female, we can set `isMale` to 0, so the predictor vector becomes:

    c(1, x, 0, 0)

When the rater is female, however, we have:

    c(1, x, 1, x)

If there are more predictors, the changes need to be propagated wherever we wish to both hold a variable to a constant and wherever we wish to make changes for graphing purposes.

## Generic Model

Coding up a model that includes explicit reference to every parameter can be cumbersome as we expand or change the model. A generic Stan model for logistic regression is:

```{r engine='cat', engine.opts=list(lang = "stan")}
data {
  int<lower = 0> N;
  int<lower = 0> K;
  int<lower = 0, upper = 1> y[N];
  
  matrix[N, K] x;
}
parameters {
  real alpha;
  vector[K] beta;
}
model {
  y ~ bernoulli_logit(alpha + x * beta);
  alpha ~ cauchy(0, 10);
  beta  ~ cauchy(0, 2.5);
}
```

This takes data, `x`, in the format of a model matrix and collects the predictors into `beta`. A good way to construct a model matrix from data uses the `model.frame` command with an R formula and extracts the matrix and response from it. For example, the following builds a model matrix for predictign `wouldDate` from `attractiveness`, `ambition`, `isMale`, their two-way interactions, and three way interaction.

```{r model-frame, eval=FALSE}
mf <- model.frame(wouldDate ~ 0 + attractiveness*ambition*isMale,
                  speed_dating)
y <- model.response(mf)
x <- model.matrix(attr(mf, "terms"), data = mf)
data <- list(y = y, x = x, N = nrow(x), K = ncol(x))
```
